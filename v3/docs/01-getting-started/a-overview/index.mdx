This is the official Substrate Developer Hub (Devhub) documentation.
These docs aim to detail the intricacies of Substrate's modular blockchain development framework.

## Before you begin

In order to get the most out of Substrate, you should have a good knowledge of computer science, programming, and basic blockchain concepts.

### Blockchain

Terminology like key-value database, header, block, client, hash, transaction, and signature should be familiar.
If blockchain is new to you, it's suggested you first take a course like the [Web3 Foundation MOOC](https://mooc.web3.foundation) before starting here.

### Rust

Substrate is built on the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which makes use of novel design patterns and features that are particularly well suited systems language for trustless systems, like blockchains.
Although you don't explicitly need to know Rust to get started with Substrate, solid Rust skills are key to becoming a proficient Substrate developer.
It is _highly_ recommended to complete the official Rust book at minimum. The [official Rust resources](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) provide this and many more materials to become proficient in Rust development.

## Get the most out of the Devhub

It is suggested that you read through the docs section here linearly though to the [runtime development](/v3/runtime) section prior to jumping into the [Tutorials](/tutorials), and [How-to Guides](/how-to-guides)
This will prime you with the key features substrate enables before exposing you to interact and customize them.
