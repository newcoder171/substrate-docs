This page will guide you through the **2 steps** needed to prepare a computer for **Substrate** development, and a simple test that you are ready to go! If you run into issues, there is a closing troubleshooting section.

## 1. OS Build dependencies installation

Do _one_ of the following based on your OS.

### Ubuntu/Debian

Use a terminal shell to execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
# May prompt for location information
sudo apt install -y git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev
```

### Arch Linux

Run these commands from a terminal:

```bash
pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang
```

### Fedora

Run these commands from a terminal:

```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel
```

### OpenSUSE

Run these commands from a terminal:

```bash
sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel
```

### macOS

Open the Terminal application and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Install Homebrew if necessary https://brew.sh/
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date, install openssl
brew update
brew install openssl
```

### Windows

  Substrate development and use is easiest, fastest, and much more supported on Unix-based operating systems like macOS or Linux.
  The examples in the Substrate Tutorials and How-to Guides use Unix-style terminals to demonstrate how to interact with Substrate from the command line.
  Native development of Substrate is _not_ very well supported! It is not optimal, but recommend to use [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL2) and follow the instructions for [Ubuntu/Debian](#ubuntudebian) if you ***must*** use a windows machine. 
  Note that WSL2 has inherent issues outside the scope of this guide to deal with that can harm performance relative to Unix-like systems. 
  Please refer to the separate [guide for native Windows development](/v3/getting-started/windows-users) if you decide to try this path.

## 2. Rust developer environment setup

This guide uses <https://rustup.rs> installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain.
First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

## Test your set-up

**Now the best way to ensure that you have successfully prepared a computer for Substrate development is to follow the steps in [our first tutorial](/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain).**
